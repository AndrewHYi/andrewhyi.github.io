A full set of Mahjong tiles are laid out on the board as a 16x9 grid. The player must 	match two identical tiles given the following set of rules:
- Two tilesw can be matched if they are the same characters and no other tiles are in between the two tiles. Adjacent tiles can always be matched.
- If a tile a matched, they are removed from the board.
- A tile can be used as a focal point to push a group of tiles through empty space on the board. If the tile can be matched after displacement, the tiles are given their new positions. Otherwise, the displacement is reversed.
