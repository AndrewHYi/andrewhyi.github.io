## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="benport.png">

Hello,

Hey there! My name is Andrew and I’m a Ruby/JS developer currently serving as Technical Lead at Riley & Grey, where I work with an awesome team dedicated to helping people build beautiful, custom wedding websites.

I’m also part of a team developing an online platform that aims to make shopping more fun and budget-minded at Parcel (with accompanying iOS app).

Occasionally, I collaborate with the guys and gals over at digital agency Friends & Family.

In my spare time, I’ve been finishing up my Masters degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a specialization in Machine Learning. (Aiming to complete the program by Summer 2019).

You can learn more about my projects and open source work on my GitHub page. And if you want to catch up on what I’m up to these days, well, this site is the place where you’ll find me rambling about programming and any other discoveries I make.




TODO: New about

I am currently studying for my B.S. degree in Computer Science at Brooklyn College. The expected graduation date is May 2020. As I am very close to finishing my curriculum, I hope to find an internship at a company that will acclimate me to the tech industry and allow me to mature as a software engineer. In the past semesters, some notable programming courses I have taken are algorithms, data structures, software design, software development, operating systems, and computer architecture.

As for my experience in programming, most of my courses have required me to learn Java, Python, and C/C++. But, I have spent some of my spare time learning to build mobile and web applications, most of which has gone into learning Objective-C and Swift using the Cocoa framework.
