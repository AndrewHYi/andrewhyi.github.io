Hey there! My name is Andrew and I'm a Ruby/JS/Elixir developer with a passion for pancakes,
mini-schnauzers and **Making. Amazing. Software**. Currently I'm the Technical Lead at
[Riley & Grey](https://www.rileygrey.com){:target="_blank"}, where I work with an awesome team
dedicated to helping people build beautiful, custom  wedding websites.

I'm also part of a team developing an online platform that aims to make online shopping more fun
and budget-minded at [Parcel](https://www.thisisparcel.com){:target="_blank"} (iOS app just
released!).

I also collaborate with the guys and gals over at digital agency
[Maki Fund](http://www.makifund.com).

You can learn more about my projects and open source work on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AndrewHYi).
And if you want to catch up on what I'm up to these days, well, this site is the place where you'll
find me rambling about programming and any other discoveries I make.

## Contact

I'm not currently looking for any additional work, but if you want to shoot me a message for whatever reason,
the best place to reach me is at my email: [andrew.yi50@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.yi50@gmail.com)
