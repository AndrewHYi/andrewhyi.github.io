Hey there, I'm Andrew and it's great to meet you!

I am a graduate of Syracuse University (BS in Economics) and Georgia Tech (MS in Computer Science). Since 2013, I have worked primarily with early-stage startups, building web and mobile applications (with a focus on Ruby/JS).

Most recently, I served as Technical Lead at [Riley & Grey](https://www.rileygrey.com), where I worked with an awesome team dedicated to helping people build beautiful, custom wedding websites. 

I was also part of the founding team of [Parcel](https://www.thisisparcel.com), developing an online platform aimed to make shopping more fun and budget-oriented.

I have frequently collaborated with the amazing folks at [Friends & Family Foundry](https://www.friendsfamily.co), where I have worked on building web/mobile applications for various clients, most recently developing applications for [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com), [Ivy](https://www.ivy.com) and [BuildBook](https://www.buildbook.co).


You can learn more about my projects and open source work on my [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/AndrewHYi). And if you want to catch up on what Iâ€™m up to these days, this site is the best place to do that. 

I'm always ready for an adventure ðŸ˜ƒ, so feel free to [contact](/contact) me with interesting dev opportunities @ <andrew.yi50@gmail.com>.



## Interests and Hobbies

When I'm not coding or daydreaming about tech, I spend my time:

- **Learning via MOOCs**: I have a passion for learning. Currently, I am taking additional advanced CS/Stats courses at Georgia Tech as a non-degree seeking student. 
- **Riding my sick OneWheel skateboard**: If you're in NYC, you might catch me riding on the West Side Highway. Yes it's dangerous, but don't worry, I always wear a helmet.
- **Hanging out with my Miniature Schnauzer**: I'll let <a href="/bagel.html" class="bagel-link">Bagel</a> know you said "hi".
- **Losing Kaggle competitions**: <https://www.kaggle.com/gtid901938773>

## Cool Stuff I've done in the Past
- Spent two years abroad in Hong Kong / China taking an immersive Mandarin Chinese course at CUHK's [Yale-China Chinese Language Centre](https://www.ycclc.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx?pg=home).
- Worked as a casework volunteer for [Hong Kong Refugee Advice Centre](https://www.justicecentre.org.hk/) (now, Justice Centre Hong Kong), helping refugees make claims at the UN.
- Conservation work in New Zealand with [International Student Volunteers](https://globalvolunteers.org/students/).
