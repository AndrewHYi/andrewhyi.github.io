Hey there! My name is Andrew Yi. I'm a Ruby/JS dev currently on a team making it easier for people to build beautiful wedding websites at [Riley & Grey](https://www.rileygrey.com){:target="_blank"} and making online shopping more fun and budget-friendly at [Parcel](https://www.thisisparcel.com){:target="_blank"}. I also collaborate with the gals and guys over at [Makifund](http://www.makifund.com).

You can learn more about my projects and public work over on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewHYi).

My thoughts and opinions on programming, design and life in general is available on this blog.
