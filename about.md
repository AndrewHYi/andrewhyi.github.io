Hey there! My name is Andrew and I'm a Ruby/JS developer currently serving as Technical Lead at [Riley & Grey](https://www.rileygrey.com){:target="_blank"}, where I work with an awesome team
dedicated to helping people build beautiful, custom wedding websites.

I'm also part of a team developing an online platform that aims to make shopping more fun and budget-minded at [Parcel]https://www.thisisparcel.com){:target="_blank"} (with accompanying iOS app).

Occasionally, I collaborate with the guys and gals over at digital agency
[Friends & Family](http://www.friendsandfamily.com).

In my spare time, I've been finishing up my Masters degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with a specialization in Machine Learning. (Aiming to complete the program by Summer 2019).

You can learn more about my projects and open source work on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AndrewHYi).
And if you want to catch up on what I'm up to these days, well, this site is the place where you'll
find me rambling about programming and any other discoveries I make.
