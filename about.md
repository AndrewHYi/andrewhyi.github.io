Hey there, I'm Andrew and it's great to meet you!

I am a graduate of Syracuse University (BS in Economics) and Georgia Tech (MS in Computer Science). Since 2013, I have worked in various capacities as a software engineer and team lead with companies of varying sizes, building web and mobile applications (with a focus on Ruby and JavaScript).

Currently I'm part of an amazing team as Senior Software Engineer at [CivicPlus](https://www.civicplus.com), building agentic AI systems and geospatial civic engagement software with the [SeeClickFix](https://www.seeclickfix.com) team.

In the past, I've served as Software Engineer and Technical Lead at [Riley & Grey](https://www.rileygrey.com), where I worked with an awesome group of folks dedicated to helping people build beautiful, custom wedding websites.

I have frequently collaborated with the amazing folks at [Friends & Family Foundry](https://www.friendsfamily.co), where I have worked on building web/mobile applications for various clients, most recently developing applications for [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com), [Ivy](https://www.ivy.com) and [BuildBook](https://www.buildbook.co).

You can learn more about my projects and open source work on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/AndrewHYi) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/AndrewHYi) pages. And if you want to catch up on what I’m up to these days, this site is the best place to do that.

I'm always prepared for a new adventure 😃, so feel free to [contact](/contact) me with interesting dev opportunities @ <andrew.yi50@gmail.com>.



## Interests and Hobbies

When I'm not coding or daydreaming about tech, I spend my time:

- **Continuous Learning**: AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate) and AWS Certified Developer (Associate). Currently exploring agentic AI patterns with MCP, OpenAI APIs, and local LLM tooling.
- **Riding my OneWheel skateboard**: If you're in Honolulu, you might catch me riding near the beach 🤙. Don't worry, I always wear a helmet.

## Cool Stuff I've done in the Past
- Spent two years abroad in Hong Kong / China taking an immersive Mandarin Chinese course at CUHK's [Yale-China Chinese Language Centre](https://www.ycclc.cuhk.edu.hk/default.aspx?pg=home).
- Worked as a casework volunteer for [Hong Kong Refugee Advice Centre](https://www.justicecentre.org.hk/) (now, Justice Centre Hong Kong), helping refugees make claims at the UN.
- Conservation work in New Zealand with [International Student Volunteers](https://globalvolunteers.org/students/).
