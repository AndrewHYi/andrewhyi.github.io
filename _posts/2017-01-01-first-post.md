I've been meaning to start a personal blog for a very long time now, and with the new year starting,
I've decided that now's the time to **just do it** ™. There's just so much I learn everday, and I
think documenting these experiences in a human-readable format (vs. scribbling scattered notes
across my various notebooks, Trello boards and Evernote documents) will help me better reinforce my
understanding of the various technical problems and solutions I've learned about. Selfish reasons
aside, I also hope to help and offer insight on these issues to other developers that may face the
same problems I've faced.

## What's next?
Of course, as important as starting a task is, forming new, positive habits is
equally as important:

<blockquote>
  <i>
    Ultimately, it’s not what you do every once in a while; it’s what you dedicate yourself to on a
    regular basis that makes the difference.
  </i>
</blockquote>

And so, I'm setting myself an "easy" goal of writing at least one post a week (with plans to
re-evaluate my blogging practices a year from now). Also, although I'm not completely happy with the
setup of the blog right now (I have a laundry list of improvements), I'm going to skip the premature
optimizations and focus on the actual content.

Expect my very first programming related post this week, where I'll go through a step-by-step
guide to setting-up and publishing a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Thanks for reading!
